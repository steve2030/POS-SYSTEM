# This the root Folder for the whole POS comprising of several microservices
## Overview

This repository contains the source code and configuration files for a microservices project. The project is designed to showcase the use of various technologies to build a scalable and resilient microservices architecture.

## Technologies Used

### 1. Ingress

Ingress is utilized as the entry point to the microservices architecture, managing external access to services and handling routing. It provides a centralized way to manage and configure external access, including load balancing, SSL termination, and path-based routing.

### 2. Kafka

Kafka is employed as the messaging backbone for communication between microservices. It facilitates asynchronous communication and ensures loose coupling between services. Topics are defined to represent different communication channels, enabling efficient and reliable message exchange.

### 3. Istio

Istio is adopted for service mesh capabilities, providing advanced features such as traffic management, security, and observability. It enhances the resilience and scalability of the microservices architecture by enabling fine-grained control over service-to-service communication.

### 4. Laravel

Laravel is chosen as the PHP framework for developing microservices. Its elegant syntax, robust features, and vibrant ecosystem make it an ideal choice for building scalable and maintainable services. Laravel provides a solid foundation for developing RESTful APIs and integrates seamlessly with other components in the microservices architecture.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into individual microservices, each serving a specific business domain or functionality. The services are loosely coupled and communicate through Kafka topics. Istio is configured to manage the traffic and enforce policies between services.
